# Description

MuHub is an online collaborative student web application designed specifically for those studying at Maynooth University, Ireland.

This repository contains the entire codebase for the application. Originally it had been the private **upstream** repository during the development process. Finally finished, it has been released to showcase the application.

You can read more about the application on my blog [here](http://www.gregorykelleher.com/blog/angularjs_project).
